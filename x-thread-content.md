### Tweet 1 (Hook)

i built a prompt that turns one logo into 70+ brand assets

social templates, favicons, OG images, business cards, email signatures, ad banners... everything

it asks you 3 questions, then builds it all with YOUR copy

here's the exact prompt (free):

---

### Tweet 2

most founders and indie hackers waste hours in canva making the same assets over and over

new social profile? open canva
need an OG image? back to canva
business card? canva again

i wanted to see if AI could just... do all of it at once

---

### Tweet 3

so i wrote a prompt that acts like a full branding team:

> brand strategist
> visual designer
> social media expert
> production specialist

you give it one logo, answer a few questions, and it outputs a complete brand asset library

with YOUR actual tagline, CTA, and brand voice

---

### Tweet 4

the key insight:

most AI branding prompts output garbage like "[Your Tagline Here]" everywhere

mine asks you upfront:
- what's your tagline?
- what's your CTA?
- what's your website/socials?
- what's your brand voice?

then every single asset uses your real copy

### Tweet 5

here's what it generates:

**logos:**
- primary, dark mode, logomark only
- monochrome versions (black, white)
- different sizes for headers, favicons

and it preserves your EXACT logo - no "creative liberties"

**social media kit:**

every platform covered:
- twitter/x (header, post templates, profile)
- instagram (profile, posts, stories)
- linkedin (banner, posts)
- youtube (banner, thumbnails)
- facebook (cover)

all with your real tagline baked in

### Tweet 10

**video/motion:**

### Tweet 11

it also outputs:

**design tokens** - CSS variables for your codebase
**JSON tokens** - includes your brand name, tagline, CTA
**figma specs** - every dimension documented
**brand guidelines** - logo rules, color specs

### Tweet 12

the prompt works in phases:

0. brand discovery (asks you questions first)
1. analyze logo (extracts colors, won't modify it)
2. core assets (logo variations, favicons)
3. digital assets (social, web, email)
4. business assets (docs, ads)
5. extended assets (patterns, video)
6. documentation

### Tweet 13

why this works better than other prompts:

1. asks questions BEFORE creating anything
2. preserves your exact logo (no AI redesigns)
3. uses your real copy everywhere
4. outputs SVG (infinitely scalable, editable)
5. covers every platform in one run

---

### Tweet 14

how to use it:

1. copy the prompt
2. point it at your logo file
3. answer the brand questions it asks
4. tell it which platform matters most to you
5. let it run

works in claude code, cursor, or any coding assistant

### Tweet 15

full prompt + example output on github:

github.com/bt489/brand-asset-generator

the prompt asks for:
- brand name + tagline
- CTA text
- website + social handles
- brand personality
- target audience
- priority platform

then builds everything custom

---

### Tweet 16 (CTA)

## Quick Tips for Posting

1. **Post time:** Early morning or lunch (when devs/founders scroll)

2. **First screenshot:** Use the twitter header showing real tagline - proves it's not placeholder garbage

3. **GitHub link:** Add it in tweet 15, not earlier (keeps people reading)

4. **Hashtags:** Skip them - they look spammy in threads

5. **Reply to yourself:** Post each tweet as a reply to keep the thread connected

6. **Pin tweet 1:** After posting, pin the hook tweet to your profile

---

## Alternative Hook Options

**Option A (problem-focused):**
"tired of AI brand prompts that output '[Your Tagline Here]' everywhere?"

**Option B (specific):**
"70+ brand assets with YOUR actual copy - not placeholder text"

**Option C (curiosity):**
"i automated my entire brand design process with one prompt that actually asks questions first"

**Option D (results):**
"this prompt replaced my $500 fiverr branding order - and used my real messaging"

## Engagement Replies to Prep

When people ask questions, have these ready:

**"Does it work with [other AI]?"**
> "wrote it for claude code but the prompt structure works anywhere - just adapt the file creation parts"

**"Can you make one for [my brand]?"**
> "that's the point - it asks you questions first then generates everything with YOUR copy"

**"What about PNG exports?"**
> "outputs are SVG so they scale infinitely - use any converter for PNG (i like svgtopng.com)"

**"What questions does it ask?"**
> "brand name, tagline, CTA, website, socials, brand personality, target audience, and which platform matters most to you"

**"This is amazing"**
> "appreciate it - let me know what you build with it"

**"Why SVG and not PNG?"**
> "SVG = infinitely scalable, editable colors, smaller files. convert to PNG whenever you need"

## Post-Thread Actions

1. Reply to your own thread with "bookmark this for your next project"

2. Quote tweet later with a single asset highlight ("the video outro alone is worth it - actually has my CTA on it")

3. If it does well, do a follow-up thread showing the brand discovery questions in detail

4. Cross-post the github link to relevant subreddits (r/SideProject, r/ClaudeAI, r/indiehackers)
