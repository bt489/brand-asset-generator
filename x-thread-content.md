### Tweet 1 (Hook)

i built a prompt that turns one logo into 70+ brand assets

social templates, favicons, OG images, business cards, email signatures, ad banners... everything

took me 20 minutes

here's the exact prompt and process (free):

### Tweet 2

most founders and indie hackers waste hours in canva making the same assets over and over

new social profile? open canva
need an OG image? back to canva
business card? canva again

i wanted to see if AI could just... do all of it at once

---

### Tweet 3

so i wrote a prompt that acts like a full branding team:

> brand strategist
> visual designer
> social media expert
> production specialist

you give it one logo and it outputs a complete brand asset library

### Tweet 4

here's what it generates:

**logos:**
- primary, stacked, logomark only
- monochrome versions (black, white, brand color)
- different sizes for headers, footers, favicons

### Tweet 10

it also outputs:

**design tokens** - CSS variables you can drop straight into your codebase

**figma specs** - every dimension, color, font weight documented

**brand guidelines** - logo usage rules, clear space, don'ts

### Tweet 11

the prompt works in phases:

1. analyze the logo (colors, typography, mood)
2. generate core assets (logo variations, favicons)
3. digital platform assets (social, web, email)
4. business assets (docs, presentations)
5. extended assets (patterns, video)
6. documentation

### Tweet 12

why this works:

the prompt doesn't just say "make me social templates"

it gives claude the context of a full design team with specific roles

each role focuses on their specialty

the output is cohesive because there's a strategic layer coordinating everything

---

### Tweet 13

how to use it:

1. copy the prompt
2. point it at your existing logo file
3. specify your priorities (social first? web first?)
4. let it run

i used claude code but it works in any coding assistant

### Tweet 14

full prompt + all generated assets are on github:

[LINK TO GITHUB REPO]

everything is SVG so you can:
- scale to any size
- edit colors easily
- convert to PNG with any tool

---

### Tweet 15 (CTA)

if you're building something and need brand assets fast, just use this

no more spending hours in canva

no more hiring designers for basic templates

one prompt, 70+ assets, 20 minutes

bookmark this and try it on your next project

## Quick Tips for Posting

1. **Post time:** Early morning or lunch (when devs/founders scroll)

2. **First screenshot:** Use the folder structure - it shows the scale immediately

3. **GitHub link:** Add it in tweet 14, not earlier (keeps people reading)

4. **Hashtags:** Skip them - they look spammy in threads

5. **Reply to yourself:** Post each tweet as a reply to keep the thread connected

6. **Pin tweet 1:** After posting, pin the hook tweet to your profile

---

## Alternative Hook Options

**Option A (curiosity):**
"i automated my entire brand design process with one prompt"

**Option B (specific):**
"70+ brand assets in 20 minutes using claude code"

**Option C (problem-focused):**
"tired of making the same canva templates over and over?"

**Option D (results):**
"this prompt replaced my $500 fiverr branding order"

## Engagement Replies to Prep

When people ask questions, have these ready:

**"Does it work with [other AI]?"**
> "wrote it for claude code but the prompt structure works anywhere - just adapt the file creation parts"

**"Can you make one for [other brand]?"**
> "that's the point - swap in your logo and it generates everything custom"

**"What about PNG exports?"**
> "outputs are SVG so they scale infinitely - use any converter for PNG (i like svgtopng.com)"

**"This is amazing"**
> "appreciate it - let me know what you build with it"
